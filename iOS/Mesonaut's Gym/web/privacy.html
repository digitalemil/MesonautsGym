Although this application asks for access to HealthKit and your location this data is not forwarded or send to any server whom do you not explicitly enter in the settings screen. The server should be under your control. The data which then get's transfered is: Phone location, heart-rate (if available) and the count of steps (if available) together with a unique id. The id can not be connected to your person. It's a global unique identifier purely needed to distinguish data from different clients.
Remember this app is only useful in combination with a Mesonaut's Gym DC/OS cluster running in a data-center. Furthermore this application is open source and published on GitHub: https://github.com/digitalemil/HortonsGym-iOS.git
