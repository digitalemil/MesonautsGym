   <H1>Welcome to Mesonaut's Gym!</H1>
   <P>Always wanted to store and process your data the same way as the big web-shops? Look no further! With Mesonaut's Gym you can collect, ingest, store and analyze your health data (heart-rate and steps currently supported). This gives you full control and you do not need to share your data with anyone. The app has two parts: One on iOS the other on DC/OS.</br>
   Warning: This app targets tech-savvy developers and is nothing for the average Joe ;-)<br>
   Let's have a look at the architecure:<br>

   <br>
   Your phone is the sensor we are going to use. For detailed instructions to set DC/OS up on please see the instructions on the bar called "More" below. Don't be worried your data is not going to end up anywhere you do not want it to be. The application will only send the data to a server you specify on the bar labeled "DC/OS". Here you point the app to your cluster installation e.g. like: "http://127.0.0.1:8181". For more details on privacy please check-out the bar labeled "More".<br>
   So let's get started: The app is going to collect heart-rate and location data and will send it to the server side in the cloud. Here's an illustration:

 But we want to do even more! Let's add some machine learning (ml) to the picture. Out-of-the-box comes a kind of "Hello World" of ml model. It's a (very) simple model which tells us in real-time that our heart-rate is too high or ok. This is also where the fun starts: You can develop your own models based on your own data and deploy them to your Mac. The out-of-the-box model was created using only a subset of the data: id and heart-rate. A good exercise would be to use Apache pig to load and transform the data until you have something like this:<br>
 <font face="courier">
    <br>HR, id<br>
    102, Me<br>
	120, Someoneelse<br>
    160, Me<br>
    165, Me<br>
    ...<br><br>

    </font>
    In our case we want our model to be a simple decision tree which falls into the category of supervised learning. So let's supervise the data. When the heart-rate seems to high we want our widget showing the heart-rate to turn read otherwise it should be green:<br>
    <font face="courier">
<br>WidgetColor HR	User<br>
    0x00FF00 	102	Me<br>
    0x00FF00 	120	Someoneelse<br>
    0xFF0000 	160	Me<br>
    0xFF0000 	165	Me<br>
    ...<br>
    <br>
    </font>
    Bring up R or SAS Miner or what have you. We are going use R here but it really does not matter as long as it can export PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language).
    Run the follwing R program and it will create your model based on your supoervised data:<br>
    <font face="courier">
<br>library(rpart)<br>
    install.packages("pmml")<br>
    require(pmml)<br>
    hrdata= read.table(file.choose(), header=TRUE, sep="\t")<br>
    <br>
    model <- rpart(WidgetColor ~ HR, data=hrdata)<br>
        saveXML(pmml(model, model.name = "Model",<br>
        app.name = "R/PMML", dataset = hrdata), file = "hrmodel.pmml")<br><br>

        </font>
        Mesonaut"s Gym has a PMML-Microservice built-in and will evaluate your model every time a message is received.<br>
        Now that's pretty awesome, isn't it? We can collect sensor data and anaylse it in real-time which opens vast possibilties for proactive maintenance of field equipment, intelligent connected cars and many many more interesting use-case.<br>
        Have fun experimenting with this! For details on how to upload your model look check out the tutorial.<br>
        <br>
        By the way this is all 100% open source:
